# Path finding for **Mountain Climbing Route** Using Digital Elevation Model (DEM)

Class Project of *Advanced GIS - Dr. Jelokhani*.

## Intro
It took humans thousands of years of experience and countless lives to find the optimum paths to ascend mountains. Finding the best route for an unexplored mountain requires competent mountain climbers and a lot of supervised surveying, which can be costly and dangerous. For planets other than the earth, the situation is even worse. 

What I wanted to try in this project was to achieve an unsupervised method to find this path with the most available and accessible Remote Sensing data, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM).
